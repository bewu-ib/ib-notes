# Demand

> [!info] Demand
> Demand is the different quantities of goods that consumers are **willing and able** to buy at different prices.

## Ceteris paribus

Ceteris paribus means that **all things other than price** that can affect the demand are *assumed to be* **constant and unchanging**. 

## Law of demand

As the price of a good **falls** → the quantity of the good demanded **increases**.
As the price of a good **rises** → the quantity demanded **decreases**.

Quantity demanded and price have **negative relationship**.

### Reasons for the law of demand

#### Substitution effect

If two products are similar, they are **substitutes**. (e.g. Coca-Cola and Pepsi)

The fall of price in one of them results in fall of demand in the other one. Similarly, the increase of price of the second one will result in increased demand for the first one.

#### Income effect

If the price for a product goes down, the **purchasing power** increases for consumers – they can buy more.

#### Law of diminishing marginal utility

> [!tip] Utility
> Utility → **satisfaction**

As you consume more units of any good, the **additional satisfaction from each additional unit will eventually start to decrease**.

## The demand curve

> [!tip]
> y-axis is always **Price (P)**
> x-axis is always **Quantity (Q)**

### Market demand

We get market demand by adding up demand curves of every product in the market.

## Shifts in demand

Price down → increase in quantity demanded
Price up → decrease in quantity demanded

**Changes in price do not shift the curve!** (The data for that is already on the curve)

> [!info] Increase in demand
> Increase in demand means that **quantity demanded increased for every price**.

**Change in demand will shift the curve**:
- increase → right
- decrease → left

### 5 shifters of demand

#### Tastes and preferences
By for example **trends or advertisements**.

#### Price of **related goods**

With substitution goods, the demand for the product will have a negative relationship with the demand for the substitute.

With **complimentary** (related) goods, the demand for the product will have a positive relationship with the demand for the related good.

#### Income

With **normal goods** (e.g. cars, coffee, good-quality meat), the demand increases with the increase of customers’ income.

With **inferior goods** (e.g. McDonald's, off-brand clothes, bad-quality meat), the demand decreases with the increase of customers’ income.

There are some goods which demand has no connection to income (e.g. toilet paper).

#### Future expectations

Lower expected future price → decrease in *demand*.
Higher expected future price → increase in *demand*.

#### Demographics

Changes in market size or demographics will change demand.
- e.g. In an ageing society the demand for child-related products will decrease.

## Change in quantity demanded vs change in demand

There are two ways to increase quantity:
- Decrease price → change in quantity demanded (the curve stays the same)
- Increase demand (the curve shifts to the right)
