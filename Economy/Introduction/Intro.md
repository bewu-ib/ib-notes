# Introduction to Economy
#5/09/2022

There are **3 main participants** in the economy:
-   consumers
-   producers
-   government / state

-   “3rd sector” (a *bonus* participant - non-profit organizations)

### 9 IB Economics Ideas
-   INTERDEPENDENCE
-   CHOICE
-   CHANGE
-   SCARCITY - unlimited needs, but limited resources
-   EFFICIENCY
-   EQUITY
-   ECONOMIC WELL BEING - quality  of living, GDP per capita
-   SUSTAINABILITY
-   INTERVENTION - government/state involvement


**Market**:
-   Centralized - e.g.  Stock market
-   Decentralized - e.g. Foreign currency exchange

**Production Inputs**
-   *Capital* -> gives interest/profit
-   *Labour* -> gives salary
-   *Land* (resources) -> gives rent (interest of the land)
-   *Entrepreneurship* (like management) -> gives salary

Some productions (e.g. Agriculture) also need **time**.

  

### Market failure 
It's more of a micro-economic phenomenon.

- e.g. Extreme price increase **is NOT a failure** 
	- the demand has grown and price increased -> market *is working as expected*.

- e.g. Odra disaster **is a market failure**:
	- Cause: River poisoned by some factory    
	- Producer lowers the cost of production by not handling the toxic waste properly
	- Market  failure - market does not include the cost of cleaning the toxic water


### Equality vs Equity

*Equality* - reducing dramatic differences
*Equity* - giving the same opportunity to everyone regardless anything

### Replication crisis

Observed in many social studies - **many experiments are non-replicable**.

### Key Economics assumptions

- Scarcity;
- Trade-off;
- Self-interest;
- Marginal costs and benefits;
- Everything can be visualised by models and graphs;

### Marginal meaning

Marginal means **additional**.
*Marginal analysis approach* is used very often in decision making.

```python
while marginal_cost < marginal_benefit:
	do_it()
```

### Production possibilities curve

PPC demonstrates:
- scarcity;
- trade-offs;
- opportunity cost;
- efficiency;

### Theoritical economics
Economists use scientific methods to make generalisations to develop *theories*. -> **Theoretical economics**;
The *theories* are then used to fix problems or meet some goals. -> **Policy economics**;

### Positive vs. normative

Positive -> based on **facts**; *avoids judgement*;
Normative -> **includes judgement**;

### Analyzing PPC

*Straight line* -> constant oppportunity cost;
*Bowed out* -> **Law of increasing opportunity cost** - as you produce more of any good, the opportunity cost will increase;

### Efficiency

**Production efficiency** -> products are being produced in the *cheapest way* (*any point on the PPC*);
**Allocative efficiency** -> products being produced are the ones most *desired by society*;

### Shifting the PPC

There are *3 PPC shifters*:
- Change in resource quantity
- Change in resource quality
- Change in technology

Change in demand -> **doesn't** shift the curve, the point moves;
Unemployment -> **doesn't** shift the curve, the point moves *inside the curve*;
